# Research Replicability Report \- Goodnews Oshiogbele

**Name**: Aimy Croner

**Date of submission**: October 16th,2025

**Poll: Were you able to reproduce the work based only on the program (not the code)?**

* Yes, I was able to reproduce the work based on the program entirely without referring to the code. However, to reproduce the summary descriptive table, I referred to the code, as I was unsure which code to use due to my unfamiliarity with STATA.   
* All my numbers are the same for each table as well\!

**Questions for discussion:**

* Where did it go off the rails?  
  * Personally, it did not go off the rails for me. The program was incredibly detailed, and it helped me stay on track to reach the same numbers/outputs.  
* Was there one error that compounded everything?   
  * No, the program was well thought out and helped me avoid big mistakes.   
* What pieces of the program left you guessing as to what to do?  
  * The steps were incredibly detailed and left me feeling certain.  
* Any comments or reflections about the reproducibility exercise? For instance, has it changed your mind about the benefits (or costs) of open science? For those in fields where replication materials are not readily available, could an emphasis on reproducibility disadvantage researchers who use qualitative methods or restricted (e.g., administrative data)?   
  * My only comment would be to remind the researcher to create a new variable before cleaning/dropping the missing values, so as not to alter the raw data. Since we do not know the reader's level of proficiency, it serves as a good reminder, in my opinion. Further, I would also suggest reminding the researcher to label the categories for each variable. This was mentioned at the beginning of the program, but as the steps continued, I forgot to do this and only noticed the missing labels when I compared my results to the original outputs that had labels. Researchers can be lazy and may not want to re-read the top of the program, so gentle reminders like these can be helpful.   
  * Additionally, I was unable to reproduce the optional table, as I believe a package needed to be downloaded to accomplish this, but the package name was not mentioned in the program.   
  * Reproducing this work served as a crucial wake-up call, highlighting the importance of producing readable programs for maintaining quantitative works. Given how complicated coding can be and how often we may need to revisit and edit our code, having a solid program helps us and our future selves document clearly what has been done. While it may take more time to construct a detailed program, the benefits associated with it (such as having detailed notes on what was done and why, as well as where an unfinished project was left off) are incomparable to the slight cost in time.  
  * This project has also shown me that my work can be more disorganized than I actually think. It has highlighted that I often assume others can easily understand my work with limited information, and also that my future self will understand why I made certain changes to my code. Thus, highlighting how much I depend on my memory, which can often let me down. Overall, this project highlighted the importance of having a detailed program, and Goodnewsâ€™s work serves as a perfect template that I will rely on to replicate in my own research.
